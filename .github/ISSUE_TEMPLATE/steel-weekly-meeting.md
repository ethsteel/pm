### Rapid-fire Status Updates

Every team member gives a 60 second TLDR on their current work, highlighting any blockers, chosen by the [Wheel of Steel](https://wheelofdeath.rip/?id=WcLWOPBC).

Anything that can't be resolved within 60s should be scheduled for discussion later in the call.

### Agenda Points

TBD - please add comments to this issue for discussion in the meeting.
