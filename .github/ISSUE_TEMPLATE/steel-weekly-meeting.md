### Rapid-fire Status Updates

Every team member gives a 60 second TLDR on their current work, highlighting any blockers:
- [Wheel of Steel](https://wheelofnames.com/axb-4cz).
- [60s timer](https://www.bigtimer.net/?minutes=1&repeat=false).

Anything that can't be resolved within 60s should be scheduled for discussion later in the call.

### Agenda Points

TBD - please add comments to this issue for discussion in the meeting.
